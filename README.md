# Research and Design Project 2023

## Description 

The following research and design project was carried out to demonstrate an understanding of statistical analysis methods on a medical prosthetic for university level three.  

One current issue the prosthetic foot industry is facing is that there is no standardised stiffness category that a prosthetic foot should conform to, based on the user body weight. This creates challenges when medical professionals and clinicians are choosing what prosthetic foot is best prescribed to an individual. Currently the standard procedure is to base this choice off the stiffness categories provided by the prosthetic foot manufacturer and follow the guidelines they set. However, this proves a challenge as each different commercial prosthetic foot has differing guidelines, which poses the question, where do you even start when trying to decide which one suits the individual best? 

The following investigation uses the findings from the case study “Prosthetic forefoot and heel stiffness across consecutive foot stiffness categories and sizes”. The paper can be accessed through the folowing link; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35536854/. Statistical analysis techniques have been performed on the data acquired from this paper to test if it provides fair comparisons on variables that are used to determine stiffness categories of the prosthetic feet. 

The hypothesis of the paper is to investigate if the stiffness categories also increase consistently as the size of the foot increases. This is another limitation in the field of prosthetic feet as it once again adds to the complexity when choosing what commercial foot suits the individual best. 

Through the use of statistical analysis, this project produces a new stiffness category for prosthetic foot stiffness was devised that could be used as an industry standard. 

## Key Topics 

The investigation was carried out in five parts, broken down below:

-	Display of Data sets in a readable format for comparisons and understanding
-	Preliminary Comparisons of Manufacturer Stiffness Categories Statistics test 
-	Devising a New Stiffness Category Labelling and Comparison System 
-	Hypothesis Testing for the Consistency of Stiffness Categories across foot size 
-	Final Correlation Analysis


## Statistical Analysis carried out 

Each method of analysis used was carried out using python and the results provided an argument for the newly devised standardised prosthetic foot stiffness category. The following methods of statistical analysis were used to aid the investigation:

- Bar charts providing a comparision between "Stiffness Category" and "Stiffness Properties"
- Box plots providing a comparison between  "User body weight" and "Stiffness Category"
- Histograms displaying differences in weight variables between manufacturers
- Bartletts Test of Variance
- Linear Regression Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
